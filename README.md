# **Google Gemini for free in Google Colab!**
## **AI Pie 2.0 - homemade chat with Gemini**
I went to Google Colab's welcome page and accidentally stumbled upon a free Gemini API without a key. I immediately took advantage of this and wrote this program for fun.

**The program supports:**
  - Commands
  - Message history
  - Automatic deletion of old messages

**Absolutely free!**

Go to the Chat section and run the cell. (hover your cursor and press the play button)
## **Instructions**
### **Commands**
`/exit` - exit the program

`/clear` - clear message history from the user's screen and AI memory

`/clear_screen` - clear message history from the user's screen
## **Latest Innovation**
